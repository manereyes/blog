# ☕ About This Raccoon

Welcome to **CTI – ☕️ Coffee, 🦝 Tails and 🔎 Insights**:  
a curated space of digital thoughts brewed with espresso and sharpened by threat intelligence.

My name is **J. Manuel Reyes López**, but here, I’m just your local raccoon—digging through logs, mapping attack paths, and connecting dots between data, adversaries, and the human element.

## 🔎 What this blog is

This site is my public **second brain**—a collection of annotated Zettelkasten-style notes, visual diagrams, loops, and field logs around topics like:

- Threat Hunting.
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) processes and case studies.
- Detection engineering, data analysis, and situational awareness.
- Notes on MITRE ATT&CK, Sigma, YARA, and emerging threats.
- Scripts, visuals, and tools I personally use or build.

Here you'll find not only how I think, but **how I learn**.

## 🦝 Why a raccoon?

Because curiosity is the root of detection, intelligence, and creativity.  
Also, raccoons are resourceful, adaptable, and sleep-deprived—just like good analysts.
